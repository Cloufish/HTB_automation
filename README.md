# HTB_automation

## What is this repository?

It's a collection of my personal scripts for solving boxes, though now as I'm writing this (03.10.2020) it's quite small but it will grow with my knowledge about solving boxes.

The scripts are also helpful to write reports in a markdown syntax! This is accomplished by converter_to_markdown.sh it scans last command from the /command_output/command_stack.txt and finds the output of each command in the same directory. You need to keep directory structure cause it's really crucial for the script to work

It is also recommended that the name of your parent directory is the name of the machine you're doing.
